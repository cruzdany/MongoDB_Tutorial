CHEAT SHEET MONGODB BY DANIEL CRUZ

use database 

#The command “use” automatically creates you a database and puts you inside of it with the name “database”

var new = {
	     “name”: “Daniel”, 
             “lastname”: “Cruz”
	  } 

#This crates you a variable called new, which have your name and your last name

new 

#This show you your variable and what is inside of it

db.new1.insert ({
		   “name”: Daniel, 
	           “lastname”: “Cruz”
		}) 

#This creates you a new database called new1 and with this command you insert the data inside of it

#This should show you this “WriteResult({ "nInserted": 1 }”

#Each new data you insert has a unique Object ID, which is generated by default by the system

#If you for example want to find the whole database you has already created, you can use this:

db.new1.find() 

#If you want to find a specific database, you have to punt inf the searcher, something like this: 

db.new1.find({
		“name”: “Daniel”
	    }) 

#This will show you the specific new1, which has the exactly data you put in order to find.

#If you for example, want to find documents which has the vendor Kettlecooked and will match with all of them, like this:
db.potions.find({"vendor": "Kettlecooked"})
{     
   "_id": ObjectId("55d232a5819aa726..."),
   "name":"Invisibility", 
   "vendor":"Kettlecooked" }  
{  "_id": ObjectId("55c3b9501aad0cb0..."),
   "name":"Shrinking", 
   "vendor":"Kettlecooked"}

#If your for example want to save inside the database a object, you could use this:

db.new1.insert ({
		    “Ingredients”: {“strength”: 2, “flavot”: 5
	       }) 

#As you could see, you not only can store strings you can also add Numbers: 2, 3.456; Boolenas: True, False; Arrays: #[
#new array]; Null values; the date, but in this case, the months start in 0, so, if for example, you, want to use the month March, 
#you should put something like this: new Date(2012, 2, 8), and this will show you the March 8th of 2012.

#Delete a single document

#The remove() collection method will delete documents that match the provided query

db.potions.remove(
	{"name": "Love"}
)

WriteResult({ "nRemoved": 1 }

#In this way the document has beed removed

#Delete multiple Documents

#If your query matches multiply documents, the remove() will delete all of them

db.potions.remove(
	{"vendor": "Kettlecooked"}
)
WritteResult({ "nRemoved": 2})

#In this way, it removed both documents that matches with the vendor
